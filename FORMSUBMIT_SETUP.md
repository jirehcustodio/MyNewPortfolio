# FormSubmit Setup Guide

## The Issue
FormSubmit is redirecting to their default page instead of your custom success page because the service needs to be activated first.

## Solution Steps

### 1. First-Time Setup (IMPORTANT!)
You need to activate FormSubmit for your email address:

1. Visit: `https://formsubmit.co/jireh4401@gmail.com`
2. Or submit the form once from your website
3. Check your email (jireh4401@gmail.com) for an activation email from FormSubmit
4. Click the activation link in the email
5. **This step is crucial!** Without activation, FormSubmit won't work properly

### 2. Form Configuration (Already Done)
The form is now configured with:
- `_next`: Redirects to your custom success page
- `_subject`: Custom email subject
- `_autoresponse`: Automatic reply to sender
- `_captcha`: Disabled for better UX
- `_honey`: Spam protection

### 3. Testing
After activation:
1. Submit a test message from your deployed website
2. You should receive the email directly in your inbox
3. The user should be redirected to your custom success page

### 4. Email Delivery
- Messages will be delivered to: jireh4401@gmail.com
- Works even when you're offline
- No dependency on your server being up
- FormSubmit handles all the email delivery

### 5. Custom Success Page
Your custom success page is at: `/contact-success`
- Professional design
- Clear confirmation message
- Links back to your portfolio

## Important Notes
- The activation email might go to spam, check there too
- Once activated, it works permanently for that email
- Messages are delivered within minutes
- FormSubmit is free up to 50 submissions per month
